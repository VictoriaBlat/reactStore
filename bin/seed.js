      "Like peanut butter, but lasts fur a long, long time.This Peanut Butter Benebone chew will drive your dog … nuts. We tried making a chew toy entirely out of Peanut Butter, but it turns out those don't last very long. Seconds, with most dogs. The folks at Benebone had a stroke of genius though, adding nylon, the classic tough-to-chew component. Your pooch will love chewing on this peanut-infused bone, and the super-durable non-peanut ingredient (there's only one) will keep even heavy chewers busy for a long while. Designed with your dog’s safety and pleasure in mind, it’s curved, so its center is up off the ground for superior chews. Importantly, the chew is indeed for chewing, and not consuming (so keep in one piece, pups).",
